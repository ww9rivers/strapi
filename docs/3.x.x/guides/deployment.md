# Deployment

### Docker

::: tip
You can also deploy using [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/strapi/strapi)
:::

The method below describes regular deployment using the built-in mechanisms.

#### #1 - Configure

Update the `production` settings with the IP and domain name where the project will be running.

**Path —** `./config/environments/production/server.json`.
```js
{
  "host": "domain.io", // IP or domain
  "port": 1337,
  "autoReload": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "admin": {
    "path": "/dashboard" // We highly recommend to change the default `/admin` path for security reasons.
  }
}
```

In case your database is not running on the same server, make sure that the environment of your production 
database (`./config/environments/production/database.json`) is set properly.

If you are passing a number of configuration item values via environment variables which is always encouraged for production environment to keep application stateless, checkout the section for [Dynamic Configuration](../configurations/configurations.md#dynamic-configurations). Here is a hint on how to do it for production, for the configuration mentioned above:
 
 **Path —** `./config/environments/production/server.json`.
```js
{
  "host": "${process.env.APP_HOST || '127.0.0.1'}"
  "port": "${process.env.NODE_PORT || 1337}",
  "autoReload": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  "admin": {
    "path": "/dashboard" // We highly recommend to change the default `/admin` path for security reasons.
  }
}
```

**⚠️  If you changed the path to access to the administration, the step #2 is required.**

#### #2 - Setup (optional)

Run this following command to install the dependencies and build the project with your custom configurations.

```bash
cd /path/to/the/project
npm run setup
```

::: note
To display the build logs use the --debug option `npm run setup --debug`.
:::

#### #3 - Launch the server

Run the server with the `production` settings.

```bash
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

::: warning
We highly recommend to use [pm2](https://github.com/Unitech/pm2/) to manage your process.
:::

### Advanced configurations

If you want to host the administration on another server than the API, [please take a look at this dedicated section](../advanced/customize-admin.md#deployment).
